## Description ## 
Book collection manager to add, remove and update books. Built using Javascript, CSS and HTML.

App starts with 2 books pre loaded and currently will not store the new books added to local storage. I hope to return back to this project later on to redo the styling and store the books added into local storage. The class test branch was done as a exercise from the classes lesson.
